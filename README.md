# Éric Rohmer
 
This is about the famous film director Éric Rohmer. As a big fan, I am interested in how his life connects to his artworks.
His works show a meticulous observation of everyday life. The flow of emotions between people also touched me very much.
Therefore, I have chosen to scrape his photographs, the "new wave" as a backdrop for the times, and all links to his works.
I have tried to use this as a starting point for visualization inspiration.
