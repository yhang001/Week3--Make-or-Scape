    <h1>This is about the famous film director Ã‰ric Rohmer. As a big fan, I am interested in how his life connects to his artworks.
His works show a meticulous observation of everyday life. The flow of emotions between people also touched me very much.
Therefore, I have chosen to scrape his photographs, the "new wave" as a backdrop for the times, and all links to his works.
 I have tried to use this as a starting point for visualization inspiration.</h1>
